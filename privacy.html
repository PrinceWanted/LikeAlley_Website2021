                        to work on what we love and do best, create programming and events. We added some language in
                        here that reflects that. We are in the business of making amazing programs for our partners. We
                        build and manage some of the programs websites, forms, reporting, and data to ensure a great
                        experience for you and our partners.

                    <bold>When does Alley use end user information from third parties?</bold>
                    <br><br>

                    Alley will collect End User Data necessary to provide Alley services to our customers. We may
                    use End User Data to look up and store additional Public Data in order to create a more complete
                    customer profile. “Public Data” is defined as information received from a third party party. We may
                    collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have indicated. You can
                    control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites
                    and changing your privacy settings.
                    <br><br>

                    <bold>Web Beacons:</bold>
                    We also may use an application known as a “web beacon” (also known as a “clear gif” or
                    a “web bug”). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It
                    can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal
                    information. For example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a
                    particular email. We do not disclose to non-service-provider third parties any personal information
                    that we collect in connection with web beacons. However, other websites that you may link to through
                    the Site also may use web beacons, so you should review other website operators’ privacy policies to
                    determine the type and extent of tracking devices used, and the information shared.
                    <br><br>
                    <bold>Third-party online tracking and behavioral advertising:</bold> We also may partner with
                    certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal and non-personal information
                    described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons
                    on the Site or in email communications from Alley. This information may be used for a variety of
                    purposes, including online behavioral advertising, as discussed below (see the section entitled “How
                    we share personal and non-personal information with third parties”).
                    <br><br>
                    We collect non-personal information through our Internet log files, which record data such as
                    browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Alley’s
                    websites. This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer Alley products and services,
                    to monitor the use of the Alley’s products and services, and to gather general demographic
                    information. We may link this information to personal information for these and other purposes such
                    as personalizing your experience for Alley’s products and services and evaluating Alley’s services
                    in general.

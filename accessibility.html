                    <p>We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are
                        committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless
                        of circumstance and ability. To fulfill this promise, we aim to adhere as closely as possible to
                        the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level, published by the World
                        Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Theseguidelines explain how to make web content more accessible to
                        people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us provide a
                        site that is accessible to all people, from the blind to the motor impaired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website utilizes various technologies all meant to make it more accessible. We utilize an
                        interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user
                        interface) and design it to their personal needs. This interface replaces the older fashioned
                        method of providing all users with the same, lesser but accessible design or user interface.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12" id="interface">
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Here are some of the interface’s capabilities:</h5>
                    <p>
                        <bold>Font Handling </bold> - users can increase and decrease its size, change its family
                        (type), adjust spacing, alignment, line height, and more. <br>
                        <bold>Color Handling </bold> - users can select various color contrast profiles such as light,
                        dark, inverted and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and
                        backgrounds, with over 7 different coloring options. <br>
                        <bold>Animations - </bold> epileptic users can stop all running animations in an instant, at the
                        click of a button. Those animations include videos, GIFs and CSS flashing transitions. <br>
                        <bold>Content highlighting </bold> - users can choose to emphasize important elements such as
                        links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements specifically.
                        <br>
                        <bold>Audio muting </bold> - users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues
                        due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly. <br>
                        <bold>Cognitive disorders </bold> - we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and
                        Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials,
                        slang, and others. <br>
                        <bold>Other options </bold> - we provide users the option to change cursor color and sizing, use
                        a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard and much more. <br> <br>
                        Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and
                        optimizes its accessibility level every 24 hours. This AI engine remediates the website’s HTML
                        issues, as well as functionality and behavior, to the use of blind people that are using screen
                        readers, and the motor impaired that are using a keyboard to operate websites. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-12" id="utilize">
                    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">We utilize AI for the following accessibility components:</h5>
                    <P>
                        <bold> Screen reader optimization </bold> - The AI runs in the background and learns the
                        website’s components top to bottom, thereby providing screen-readers with meaningful data using
                        the ARIA set of attributes. For example, it will provide accurate form labels; descriptions for
                        actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for
                        form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, the AI scans all of the website's images and provides an accurate and meaningful
                        image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag. It will also extract
                        texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition)
                        technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, click the Alt+1 keyboard
                        combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn adjustments on as soon
                        as they enter the website.
                        ‍ <br><br>
                        <bold> Keyboard navigation optimization </bold> - The AI adjusts the website’s HTML, as well as
                        adding various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website fully operable by a keyboard.
                        This includes the ability to navigate the entire site using the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys, operate
                        dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with ESC, trigger buttons and links using the Enter
                        key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, fill them in with the
                        Spacebar or Enter key, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus (available at any
                        time by clicking Alt+1). The AI will also handle triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus
                        towards them as soon as they appear, and It’ll not let the focus drift outside of it, for best
                        orientation.

                        We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our
                        users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible.
                        Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all the modern, major and popular
                        systems that comprise over 95% of the users’ market share and include: Google Chrome, Mozilla
                        Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, Microsoft Edge and I.E 11 or above, JAWS and NVDA (screen
                        readers), both for Windows and for MAC users. This website is operable using other systems and
                        platforms as well, though we are not officially supporting them and recommend users to utilize
                        the aforementioned.

                        committed to providing programming that is accessible to the widest possible audience,
                        regardless of circumstance and ability. We also have the mission to create good change and

                        <br><br>
                        To remain committed to this mission we are now offering ASL interpreters for our virtual events
                        upon request. If an ASL interpreter is needed please do not hesitate to reach out to us at
                        events@alley.com at least one week prior to the event so accommodations can be made.
                        Additionally, as always our events will be recapped with closed captioning and transcripts. We
                        are excited to offer this and offer support to our community

                        Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, it is
                        possible that there will still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the
                        process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them
                        accessible. Still, we are constantly improving the accessibility interface, adding, updating and
                        improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is
                        meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, at any time and in accordance with
                        technological advancements.

                        If you’ve discovered a bug or malfunction, if you find any aspect of the interface difficult to
                        use, or if you have improvement ideas, we’ll be happy to hear from you. Simply email us at
